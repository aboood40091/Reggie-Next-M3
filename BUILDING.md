# DISCLAIMER
- Program error reports tend to show the directory of the build location! So it will go `C:/Users/[yourname]/...` for example.

- Building on Mac and Linux hasn't been tested yet so it might not work on those platforms.

## Building Without Cython
Building without Cython will slow down the program a bit when it deals with anything LH related.

1. You need to have at least Python 3.5, so make sure to install it and add it to `PATH` on Windows.
1. Run the following command to install the required modules:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5 nsmblib https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.zip
   ```
1. In `libs/__init__.py`, change the line `has_cython = True` to `has_cython = False`.
1. (Optional) You can change the version by editing the value of `PROJECT_VERSION` value in the file `build_reggie.py` and by editing the three `ReggieVersion` values in the file `globals_.py`.
1. If you're in Windows, you can run the `build_reggie.bat` script. On other platforms, you have to run the following command in the folder `build_reggie.bat` is in: `python -OO build_reggie.py`

After the script finishes, the executable can be found in the `distrib` folder.

## Building With Cython
Building with Cython will speed up the program a bit when it deals with anything LH related, but it's also more work to set up Cython when you're building Reggie Next.

1. You **need** to use Python 3.7, so make sure to install it and add it to `PATH` on Windows.
1. On that version, run this command to add the required modules. On Windows, you can replace `python` with `py -3.7` to make sure the modules are installed on the right version.
   ```
   python -m pip install PyQt5 nsmblib Cython https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.zip
   ```
1. In `libs/__init__.py`, remove the lines:
   ```
   import pyximport
   pyximport.install()
   ```

1.
   - On Windows: In the `libs` folder, run the `compile.bat` script.
   **NOTE:** The `compile.bat` script doesn't look for Python 3.7 specifically, so if nothing happens when ran, edit the script to use whichever version of Python you have has Cython installed.
   - On other OSes:
     1. Run this command in the `libs` folder directory and replace `python` with (the path to) the Python 3.7 executable:
        ```
        python compile.py build_ext --inplace
        ```
     1. Rename the created `.so` files in the new libs folder to correspond with their respective `.pyx` name (but don't change the extension).

1. Delete the `.pyx` files, and other files and folders that were created in the previous step.

1. - Windows: Download the Microsoft Build Tools 2015 installer from the following URL.
   http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/F/7/5F7ACAEB-8363-451F-9425-68A90F98B238/visualcppbuildtools_full.exe

   - On other OSes: Make sure you have a compatible C compiler with Cython (for example `gcc`). GCC is usually preinstalled on Linux, but if you don't have it, the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential` will fetch everything you need. On MacOSX, you can retrieve `gcc` by installing Appleâ€™s XCode through running the command `xcode-select --install`.

1. (Optional) You can change the version by editing the value of `PROJECT_VERSION` in `build_reggie.py` and the three `ReggieVersion` values in `globals_.py`.

1. - Windows: Run `build_reggie.bat`.
   - Other OSes: Run the following command in `build_reggie.py`'s directory. Make sure `python` refers to Python 3.7.
     ```
     python -OO build_reggie.py
     ```

After the script finishes, the executable can be found in the `distrib` folder.
